# âœ¨ Interactive Gesture-Based Aquarium

This project is a creative exploration of **gesture-based interaction**, where creatures on the screen respond to your hand movements in real time. Using camera and hand-tracking technology, you can **drag**, **move**, and **interact** with these creatures â€” and watch how they respond organically to your gestures.
